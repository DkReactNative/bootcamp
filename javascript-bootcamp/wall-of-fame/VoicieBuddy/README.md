# :rocket: VoicieBuddy Web Application
### Real Time Text to Speech Conversion built with HTML5, CSS, Vanilla JS and Web Speech API.
:rocket: Project is live at : [VoicieBuddy.com](https://voiciebuddy.bhavyajain21.repl.co/index1.html)

### Idea for the Project:
* The solution mainly focuses on converting text to speech to make reading and learning more efficient.
* The idea came in mind, when I was reading a documentation which is more than 1000 pages long, at that time I
  thought that â€“ How about if someone could read it for me and I can concentrate on whatever is being
  spoken.
* This idea can help millions of folks out there, who learn things by listening , rather than reading.
* The solution can be helpful for people with weak eyesight problems and can be used anywhere around the
  world.
* The user will be given choices for listening the text in his/her own country accent, which can also be
  helpful in improving vocabulary.

### Working of the Project:
* It is a web app where user can write the lines of text which the user wants to listen.
* User can also paste lines from the web or any other source which is too lengthy to read and user can listen them.
* User can also change the pitch of the voice in which the text is being spoken.
* User is also given an option to increase or decrease the rate at which the text is being spoken.
* User can choose different accent according to his/her own country and listen to the text.
* User can now enjoy learning by just listening to the text that is too lengthy to read and hence makes learning and reading more efficient.
